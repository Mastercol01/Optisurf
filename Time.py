    of hours. Had we used timestamp_hms_to_float(timestamp, unit = "s"),

    """
    Creates a pandas.Series using pandas.date_range, given the input parameters.
    For the application in question, working directly with pandas.date_range 
    would have required a lot of pos-processing each time given. Hence this
    wrapper is meant to facilitate the process.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    
    start_time : str
        This is the time from which we want to start the time series.
        That is, it is the first time period we consider. It must be a string 
        of the form "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss". 
        
    end_time : str
        This is the time we want the time series to end on. That is, it is
        the last time period we consider. It must be a string of the form
        "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss".  
        
    min_hms : str or None
        If str, this is is the minimum hms (hour-minute-second) value for a 
        Timestamp that is allowed within the time series. Any Timestamps whose
        hms values are strictly below this threshold, are removed from the time
        series. It must be a string of the form "hh:mm:ss". If None, this 
        condition gets ignored.
        
    max_hms : str or None
        If str, this is is the maximum hms (hour-minute-second) value for a 
        Timestamp that is allowed within the time series. Any Timestamps whose
        hms values are strictly above this threshold, are removed from the time 
        series. It must be a string of the form "hh:mm:ss". If None, this 
        condition gets ignored.
    
    time_interval : str
        This is the time we want to have in-between time samples. That
        is, how far apart each time sample is from one another. It must
        be in the following format: number-unit. Example: "10-s" means ten
        seconds, "20-min" means 20 minutes, "2-h" means two hours and 
        "5-d" means five days. Supported units are: "s", "min", "h" and "d".
        
    UTC : str
        Standard time zone we wish to consider. If positive, it should
        be given in the format: "hh:mm:ss" and if it is negative it should 
        be given as "-hh:mm:ss".
        
        
    Returns
    -------
    time_series : pandas.Series of pandas.Timestamp objs
        Time series from 'start_time' to 'end_time' of time period 
        equal to 'time_interval', with all Timestamps whose hms values 
        lie outside the closed interval ['min_hms', 'max_hms'], having
        been removed.
        
        
        
    Notes
    -----
    1) "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss" format means year-month-day hour:minute:second
       format. Eg.: "2020-10-05 14:30:25" means 5th of October of the year 2020,
       at 14 hours, 30 minutes and 25 seconds.
       
    2) "hh:mm:ss" format means hour:minute:second format. Eg.: "14:30:25"
       means 14 hours, 30 minutes and 25 seconds.

    """
    Creates a pandas.Series using 'date_range' function, for each day of the 
    specified interval, given the input parameters, and returns all the 
    computed time series as a dictionary. This function is similar to
    the 'date_range' function, but this fucntion includes a new functionality,
    which is the ability to compute the values of sunrsie and 
    sunset, and subsequently use them as the values for min_hms and max_hms.
    Hence why each time_series needs to be stored independently.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    
    start_time : str
        This is the time from which we want to start to compute the time data.
        That is, it is the first time period we consider. It must be a string 
        of the form "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss". 
        
    end_time : str
        This is the time we want the time data to end on. That is, it is
        the last time period we consider. It must be a string of the form
        "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss".  
        
    min_hms : str, None or "sunrise"
        If str, this is is the minimum hms (hour-minute-second) value for a 
        Timestamp that is allowed within the each day's time series. Any 
        Timestamps whose hms values are strictly below this threshold, are
        removed from said time series. It must be a string of the form 
        "hh:mm:ss". If None, this condition gets ignored. If "sunrise", the
        sunrise time for the location specified is computed and used as the 
        value for min_hms.
        
    max_hms : str, None or "sunset"
        If str, this is is the maximum hms (hour-minute-second) value for a 
        Timestamp that is allowed within the each day's time series. Any 
        Timestamps whose hms values are strictly above this threshold, are
        removed from said time series. It must be a string of the form 
        "hh:mm:ss". If None, this condition gets ignored. If "sunset", the
        sunset time for the location specified is computed and used as the 
        value for max_hms.
    
    time_interval : str
        This is the time we want to have in-between time samples of each day.
        That is, how far apart each time sample is from one another. It must
        be in the following format: number-unit. Example: "10-s" means ten
        seconds, "20-min" means 20 minutes, "2-h" means two hours and 
        "5-d" means five days. Supported units are: "s", "min", "h" and "d".
        
    UTC : str
        Standard time zone we wish to consider. If positive, it should
        be given in the format: "+hh:mm:ss" and if it is negative it should 
        be given as "-hh:mm:ss".
        
    skip_polar_nights : bool
        If True, errase all NaN values from 'time_data' variable, that 
        correspond to polar nights. If False, these NaN values are not
        removed. This applies only when min_hms == "sunrise" or 
        max_hms == "sunset". Default is True.
        
    time_delta : str
        This is how much time of leeway we want to give the code, so that it
        is able to catch the actual sunrise and sunset events within
        each day's time series. It must be in the following format: number-unit. 
        Example: "10-s" means ten seconds, "20-min" means 20 minutes, "1-h" 
        means one hour. Supported units are: "s", "min" and "h". This applies 
        only when min_hms == "sunrise" or max_hms == "sunset". Default is True.
        Default is "5-min".
        
        
    Returns
    -------
    time_data : dict of pandas.Series of pandas.Timestamp objs
        Dictionary whose keys are (year, month, day), where the range
        of year, month and day are defined by the start_time and end_time
        variables. Each key contains a time series of period 
        equal to 'time_interval', with all Timestamps whose hms values 
        lie outside the closed interval ['min_hms', 'max_hms'], having
        been removed.
        
        
        
    Notes
    -----
    1) "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss" format means year-month-day hour:minute:second
       format. Eg.: "2020-10-05 14:30:25" means 5th of October of the year 2020,
       at 14 hours, 30 minutes and 25 seconds.
       
    2) "hh:mm:ss" format means hour:minute:second format. Eg.: "14:30:25"
       means 14 hours, 30 minutes and 25 seconds.
       
       
    Warnings
    --------
    1) "WARNING: Using a 'time_delta' of less than 5 minutes runs the risk of 
        not catching the actual sunset and sunrise events within each day's
        time series."
        
    2) "WARNING: POLAR NIGHTS DETECTED" (Happens if skip_polar_nights is False)
    
    3) "WARNING: POLAR NIGHTS DETECTED. Polar Nights will be removed from
       the time_data dict. Hence, some key-value pairs may be missing for
       certain dates." (Happens if skip_polar_nights is True)
       
    4) "WARNING: Data does not increase monotonically from day to day. This may
        happen because of 3 reasons. Either: (1) 'time_interval' variable is 
        too big, (2) 'time_delta' variable is too big or (3) the site of 
        computation lies near or inside a polar circle."
